# Pendulum Neural Network Simulator

A dynamic web application for creating, training, and simulating neural networks to predict the behavior of a double pendulum. This project leverages **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Node.js** for the front-end, and **Java** for the back-end, incorporating machine learning capabilities to model the complex dynamics of a double pendulum.

## Features

### Frontend

- **Neural Network Configuration**: Customize the architecture (e.g., layers, neurons, activation functions).
- **Real-time Visualization**: Visualize the pendulum dynamics and the neural network's predictions using a 2D canvas.

### Backend

- **Dynamic Neural Network Creation**: Train neural networks using specified configurations.
- **Builder-Pattern**: Used a builder design pattern in the backend
- **Pendulum Simulation**: Simulate pendulum motion using numerical integration methods.
- **RESTful APIs**: Enable seamless communication between the frontend and backend.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **React**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **P5JS**: For the dynamic visualizatoin of the pendulum
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application with modern, responsive designs.

### Backend

- **Java with Spring Boot**: For managing APIs and neural network logic.
